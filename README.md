# Learning Path

Welcome to my repository! This repo is dedicated to tracking all my learning activities as I embark on my journey in software engineering. I have been interested in this field for a long time, and Iâ€™m excited to document my progress.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to ensure that I keep track of what I am learning and to reflect on my growth as a software engineer. If you ever come across this repo, I will strive to include links to any courses or books that I use throughout this journey.

## Note

If you find things to be disorganized or confusing, please refer to the README file. I do my best to maintain a list of the books and links to the courses. 

**Disclaimer:** I am not responsible for anything you may use from this repository; its purpose is solely to help me track my progress.

**Wish me luck!**
