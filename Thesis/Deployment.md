# Deployment Strategies

## 1.0 Big Bang Deployment

Big Bang deployment involves pushing all changes to production at once. This approach requires shutting down the old system to switch to the new one, leading to some downtime. However, if everything goes according to plan, the downtime is usually short.

### Key Points:
- Requires thorough preparation and testing.
- Best suited for scenarios involving intricate database upgrades.
- High-risk but simple in terms of execution.

## 2.0 Rolling Deployment

Rolling deployment allows a system to be updated incrementally over time. It follows a staged rollout where the new version of the application is gradually deployed, preventing downtime.

### Key Points:
- Ensures continuous availability.
- Issues can be identified and mitigated early.
- Slower process compared to Big Bang deployment.

## 3.0 Blue-Green Deployment

Blue-Green deployment utilizes two identical production environments, named Blue and Green. One environment (e.g., Blue) serves users while the other (e.g., Green) remains idle for testing.

### How It Works:
1. The current version (Blue) serves users.
2. The new version is deployed to the idle environment (Green).
3. After testing, the load balancer switches traffic to the Green version.

### Key Points:
- Zero downtime.
- Easy rollback in case of failure.
- Resource-intensive due to maintaining two environments.
- More complex to set up.
- A popular strategy for high-availability systems.

## 4.0 Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves rolling out updates to a small subset of users before a full rollout. This allows careful monitoring of the new version before widespread deployment.

### Key Points:
- Targeted rollout to minimize risk.
- Continuous monitoring of performance and errors.
- Not a standalone strategy; often combined with other deployment methods.

## 5.0 Feature Deployment

Feature deployment allows teams to release new features independently of full application deployments. This is commonly achieved using feature flags or toggles, enabling controlled exposure of new functionality to users.

### Key Points:
- Features can be turned on or off dynamically without redeploying the entire application.
- Allows A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts.
- Reduces risk by enabling quick rollbacks of problematic features.
- Supports continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## 6.0 Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) is a software development approach where every code change that passes automated testing is automatically released to production. It extends Continuous Integration (CI) by ensuring that updates reach users without manual intervention.

### Key Points:
- Fully automated deployment pipeline.
- Reduces the time between development and release.
- Ensures faster feedback and iteration cycles.
- Requires robust automated testing and monitoring.
- Minimizes deployment risks through incremental updates.
