variables 
we set the variable using the = 
int truth = 42;
we declare a variable truth and assign it a value 42

integers can be concatenated to a string in other programsm

int truth = 42;
double pie = 3.1415
bool valid =  true;
string magic = “The magic number”;
Console.WriteLine(magic + truth); //concatiniation 

when we concatenate using the + operator it automatically converts other data types like int double and bool to their representatives when concatenated with a string 

variable names must be unique inside a code block 
declare each variable once 
you can reassign a variable 

##Assigninng a value to a variable 
//declare a variable and assign it a value 
int number = 42;
with this the compiler creates the int variable and stores the value to memory 
//we use the variable to access the store information  
— the variable name is the reference to the value . 
—once the reference to the value the command prints its 

Console.WriteLine(number);

number = 21;
this is reassignment of the value equal sign tend to change the value 


###Variable typing 

C# variable are statically typed = means once a variable is declared into a certain type the type does not change. 

This days there is a librial keyword dynamic we treat C# as static typing 

we can’t declare and assign a number to a variable and reassign it with a string 

int magic = 42; //declare and assign 
magic = “Magic” reassign
f
for string to numbers and number to strings its not allowed 

// exception you can assign an integer to a double  
int number = 456;
number = 456.6464;
or 
double decimal = 10;
int number = 20;
decimal = number // also works 

but not the other way around 
int  number = 4.2;

Type Compatibility and Conversion
numeric types 

You can assign an int to a double no risk of data loss
double can hold both integers and floating points numbers = implicit conversion 

note explicitly cat a double to an int
i

i can assign an int to a double but can’t assign a double to an int unless explicitly cast the double to an int

##naming variable
rules for naming for naming variable 
-cannot contain special characters such as !?åö
-cannot contain empty spaces also called whitespaces 
-  start with lowercase letter 
- should be written in camera case 

## reading different kinds of variables fro the user 


dotnet new console -n name of file

built in methods 

# converting values to integers 
`Convert.ToInt32()`;

#convert to a decimal or double
-`Convert.ToDouble()`

#convert a valueto string 
`convert.ToString()`

## convert string value boolans 
string truth = "True";
bool booleanValue  = System.Convert.ToBoolean(truth);
