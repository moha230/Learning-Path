# The C# Programming Language

set of definitaions in classes that contain methods and the methods contain the program logic 

The c# language is distributed togthere with a special environment on which it is executed called `Common Language Runtime (CLR)`

NET Framework, which includes CLR, a
bundle of standard libraries providing basic functionality, compilers,
debuggers and other development tools


# The Microsoft .NET Framework

.NET Framework generally consists of an environment for the
development and execution of programs, written in C# or some other
language, compatible with .NET (like VB.NET, Managed C++, J# or F#)

* .NET programming languages (C#,F#)
* an envrornment of execution of managed code CLR which execute the c program in a controlled manner 
* a set `development tools` such as the csc `c sharp compiler` compiler turn c# code to intermediate code into `MSIL`.
* a set of `standard libraries` like ADO.net 

The .NET Framework provides a wide range of development tools to assist in creating applications, services, and libraries. Below is a list of the most commonly used tools in .NET Framework development:

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Programming

### **Summary of "Introduction to Programming" Chapter**

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of programming and guides readers through writing their first program. It explains the connection between programming, computers, and programming languages. Key topics covered include:

1. **Overview of Programming and Computers:**
   - Understanding what programming is and its relationship with computers and programming languages.

2. **Software Development Stages:**
   - A brief overview of the main stages involved in software development.

3. **Introduction to C# and the .NET Platform:**
   - Exploring the C# programming language and the .NET platform.
   - Familiarization with various Microsoft technologies used in software development.

4. **Programming Tools:**
   - Discussion on the auxiliary tools required to program in C#.
   - Writing, compiling, and running a C# program using:
     - The command line.
     - Microsoft Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE).

5. **MSDN Library:**
   - An introduction to the .NET Framework documentation, which serves as a vital resource for exploring the language's capabilities.

This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding programming and provides practical guidance on setting up the tools and writing the first program in C#.


# Chapter 2: Primitive Types and Variables

### **Summary of "Primitive Types and Variables" Chapter**

This chapter provides a comprehensive introduction to primitive types and variables in C#. Key topics include:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   - Overview of common data types:
     - Integer types.
     - Real floating-point types.
     - Boolean, character, string, and object types.

2. **Working with Variables:**
   - Understanding what variables are and their characteristics.
   - Declaring variables, assigning values, and initializing variables.

3. **Value and Reference Types:**
   - Explanation of the two main categories of data types in C#:
     - **Value Types**: Store data directly.
     - **Reference Types**: Store references to data locations.

4. **Literals:**
   - Introduction to literals and their types.

The chapter lays a strong foundation for working with data in C#, focusing on understanding data types, variables, and the distinctions between value and reference types.


# Chapter 3: Operators and Expressions



In the chapter "Operators and Expressions," we explore the operators in C# and the operations they perform on various data types. The chapter explains operator priorities and introduces different types of operators based on the number of arguments they take and the operations they perform. It also examines typecasting, its necessity, and how to work with it. Finally, the chapter describes expressions and illustrates their use with examples.

The content of the chapter is adapted from a foundational programming guide and translated into English for clarity and broader accessibility.

# Chapter 4: Console Input and Output

In the chapter "Console Input and Output"
, we will get familiar with the
console as a means for data input and output. We will explain what it is,
when and how it is used, what the concepts of most programming languages
for accessing the console are. We will familiarize ourselves with some of the
features in C# for user interaction and will examine the main streams for
input-output operations Console.In, Console.Out and Console.Error, the
class Console and the utilization of format strings for printing data in
various formats. We will see how to convert text into a number (parsing),
since this is the way to enter numbers in C#.

# Chapter 5: Conditional Statements
