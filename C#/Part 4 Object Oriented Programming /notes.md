 # Object Oriented Programming

## Classes and objects


* class defines the attributes of an object 
* information related to them (instance variables and properties)
* commands ie methods 

what  structured programming paradigm 

this paradigm is a standard perspective or a set of ideas 


structured programming paradigm is a programming paradigm that emphasizes breaking down a program into smaller manageable adn logical sections 
The sections are orginized too 

Functions or Procedures: Small, reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.


1. abstraction 

* hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object or concept .
* it focus on how an abject does rather than how it does it. 

2. Encapsulation 

* is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods(functions) together into a single unit (a class) 
* it restricts direct access to some data allowing it to be modified only through specific methods

3. Generalization

is the proccess of extracting shared characteristics  from two or more classes and combining them to a generalized super class

4. Polymorphism

* the condition of occurring in many forms . This allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of common superclass 

* allows the same methods to behave differently bases on the object that calls it 

Assume you undertake the following activities on a daily basis. Arrange this list into a sensible order then split this list into
three blocks of related activities and give each block a heading to summarise the activities carried out in that block.

Get out of bed*
Eat breakfast*
Park the car*
Get dressed*
Get the car out of the garage*
Drive to work*
Find out what your boss wants you to do today*
Feedback to the boss on today’s results.*
Do what the boss wants you to do*


first order the task 

[1. Get out of bed
2. Eat breakfast
3. Get dressed] block 1 wake up and get ready for work 
[4. Get the car out of the garage
5. Drive to work
6. Park the car] block 2  drive to work 
[7. Find out what your boss wants you to do today
8. Do what the boss wants you to do
9. Feedback to the boss on today’s results.] block 3 

wake up  
go to work 
do your job  


Activity 2
Imagine a personal address book with some data stored about your friends
Name,
Address,
Telephone Number.
List three things that you may do to this address book.
Next identify someone else who may use an identical address book for some purpose other than storing a list of friends.

store cutsomer information
use it to store friends numbers 
use it for storing local companeies data 

finde out details of friends 

1.3 Why use the Object Orientation Paradigm?

poor maintainability: the system is hard to understand and revise when, as is inevitable, requests for change
arise.
•	 Statistics show 70% of the cost of so$ware is not incurred during its initial development phase but is
incurred during subsequent years as the so$ware is amended to meet the ever changing needs of the
organisation for which it was developed. For this reason it is essential that so$ware engineers do everything
possible to ensure that so$ware is easy to maintain during the years a$er its initial creation. 


1.4 Object Oriented Principles

Activity 3 Consider your home and imagine you were going to swap your home for a week with a new friend.
Write down three essential things you would tell them about your home and that you would want to know about their
home.
Now list three irrelevant details that you would not tell your friend.

relevant 
tell her the address 
where the keys are 
which room she will use 

irrelevant
how the buidling is built 
what type of floors i have 
where the windows are 


Activity 4 Consider your home and write down one item, such as a television, that you use on a daily basis (and brie$y
describe how you operate this item).
Now consider how di"cult it would be to describe the internal components of this item and give full technical details of
how it works. 

robot vacuum cleaner 
use a mobile app adn the roosms are number in the app so i clean the each room at a time 


Activity 5 Consider the people who work in a hospital-list three common occupations of people you would expect to be
employed there.
Now for each of these common occupations list two or three speci#c categories of staff.

nurse 
doctor 
therapist


 doctor 
 trainee doctor 
 junior doctor
 surgoan 
 radiolgist 


 nurse 
 Triage nurse,
Midwife,
Ward sister

therapist
 Psychotherapists
 Clinical Psychologists
Occupational Therapists (OTs)


Activity 6 Make one statement about doctors that you would consider to be true for all doctors and make one statement
about surgeons that would not be true for all doctors. 

 all doctors have a knowledge of drugs, can diagnose medical conditions and
can prescribe appropriate medication.
For surgeons you could say that they know how to use scalpels and other specialised pieces of equipment and they can
perform operations. 

Activity 9 Consider a computer system that will allow items to be reserved from a library. Imagine one such item that you
may like to reserve and list two or three things that a librarian may want to know about this item. 

item book 
title 
isbn number 
year of publication
