# Variables and setting a value

Variables are used to store information during the execution of a program. A variable is created in the computer's memory when it is declared, where it remains for the duration of the program until the variable is no longer needed. Each variable is associated with a value that can be changed (i.e. reset) during the execution of the program.

A variable is declared with the keyword var, followed by the variable name. This is followed by an equal sign, followed by the value that will be assigned to the variable. In the example below, a variable named is created and vuosithe value is set to the number 2020. The year is then printed as part of a print statement.


# Strings and numbers

Allowed and disallowed variable names
There are a few rules for naming variables. In this course, variable names must begin with a letter and can contain letters and numbers. Variable names cannot contain spaces, and variable names cannot contain special characters such as the equal sign. If a variable describes something that would be explained in more than one word, the words are combined by capitalizing the first character of the words following the first word. For example, variable sananEnsimmainenMerkkiwould be a suitable name for a variable that describes the first character of a word
