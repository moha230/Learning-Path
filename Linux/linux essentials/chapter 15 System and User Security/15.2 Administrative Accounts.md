# 15.2 Administrative Accounts

Logging in as the root user allows you to execute commands as admin. 

`sudo` commnand 

what is it `sudo`

`sudo` stands for substitute user do or super user do it temporarily elevate your current user account.


Many modern Linux distributions and Unix-like systems lock the root account by default as a security measure. Here are some common ones that do so:

1. **Ubuntu**: On Ubuntu, the root account is locked by default. Instead, users are encouraged to use `sudo` to gain root privileges temporarily. The root account is created but has no password assigned, which effectively prevents direct login.

2. **Debian**: Similar to Ubuntu, Debian locks the root account by default during installation if you choose to set up a non-root user with `sudo` privileges. Users can still enable it by setting a root password if they need direct root access.

3. **Fedora**: Fedora also typically locks the root account by default and relies on `sudo` for administrative tasks. However, it allows users to enable the root account if necessary by setting a password.

4. **macOS**: On macOS (a Unix-based OS), the root account is disabled by default. Users can enable it if needed, though Apple strongly recommends using `sudo` or administrative accounts for elevated privileges instead.

5. **OpenSUSE**: On OpenSUSE, during the installation process, the root account is created, but users can choose to disable it by not setting a root password and assigning administrative privileges to a regular user account.

6. **CentOS/RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)**: Although not locked by default on all installations, CentOS and RHEL allow root access but often encourage using `sudo` for better security in environments where root access should be restricted.

These systems lock the root account by either not setting a password or by modifying the `/etc/shadow` file to make it inaccessible. This approach reduces the attack surface, as direct root logins are a significant security risk, especially for remote connections.


To check if the root account is enabled on a Linux or Unix-like system, you can examine the root account's status in a few different ways:

### 1. Check the `/etc/shadow` File
The `/etc/shadow` file contains user account information, including whether an account is locked or disabled.

- Open the `/etc/shadow` file:
  ```bash
  sudo cat /etc/shadow | grep root
  ```
- Look at the output. The entry for the root account will look something like this:
  ```
  root:!:18343:0:99999:7:::
  ```
  - If there is an exclamation mark (`!`) or an asterisk (`*`) in the password field for the root user, it means the root account is locked (i.e., no password is set, and direct login is disabled).
  - If there is a hashed password (a long string of characters) instead of `!` or `*`, then the root account has a password and is enabled.

### 2. Use the `passwd -S` Command
This command provides a summary of the password status for an account.

- Run the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo passwd -S root
  ```
- You’ll get an output similar to:
  ```
  root L 05/20/2022 0 99999 7 -1
  ```
  - If the root status shows `L`, it means **Locked**.
  - If it shows `P`, it means **Password set** and the root account is enabled.

### 3. Attempt to Switch to Root with `su`
While this method is less direct, you can try switching to the root account with the `su` command.

- Type the following command:
  ```bash
  su -
  ```
- If you’re prompted for a root password and it lets you log in as root, then the root account is enabled. If you get an error like `authentication failure` or `account locked`, then it’s disabled.

### 4. Use the `sudo -i` Command as a Test
If you have `sudo` privileges, this command allows you to check if you can switch to a root shell:

```bash
sudo -i
```

If the root account is enabled, this should give you a root shell.

# 15.2.1 Switching Users

The `su ` command stand for substitute user or switch user 

It can switch to other users 

```bash
su [options] [username];
```

* when switch in user the login shell option is recommended 

_why this_ 

a login shell loads initialization files like .profile, .bash_profile, or .bashrc, depending on the shell and system configuration. These files set up critical settings such as:

* PATH variable: Determines the directories where the shell looks for executable files.
* Environment variables: Custom settings like LANG (for language), HOME (for home directory), and others specific to the user.
* Shell customizations: Aliases, functions, and other shell behaviors.

if the admin omits the login shell the setting may not be loaded leading to unexpected behavior or permission issues 

 The login shell option can be specified one of three ways:

 ```bash
su -

su -l

su --login
 ```

 if the user name is not specified the su command open a new shell as root user 

 **starting a shell at root user commands**

 ```bash
su - root 

su - 
 ```

 After pressing Enter to execute either one of these commands, the user must provide the password of the root user to start the new shell.

This output provides details about the **user and group IDs** for a user named **"student"** on a Linux or Unix-like system. Let’s break it down:

- **`uid=1000(student)`**: The **User ID (UID)** for the user "student" is **1000**. This unique identifier is assigned to the user account and is used by the system to track file ownership, permissions, and access.

- **`gid=1000(student)`**: The **Group ID (GID)** for the primary group of the user "student" is **1000**. By default, Linux assigns a primary group with the same name and ID as the user.

- **`groups=1000(student),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),101(lxd)`**: This shows all the **groups** that the user "student" belongs to. The groups listed give the user additional permissions beyond what is allowed by the primary group. Here’s a summary of each group:

  - **`1000(student)`**: Primary group for the user.
  - **`4(adm)`**: The **adm** group usually has permissions to view system logs. Members of this group can read log files in `/var/log`, which are otherwise restricted.
  - **`24(cdrom)`**: The **cdrom** group allows access to CD-ROM and DVD drives.
  - **`27(sudo)`**: The **sudo** group allows the user to execute commands as the root user (or another user) using `sudo`, giving them administrative privileges.
  - **`30(dip)`**: The **dip** group allows access to dial-up networking, modems, and other network-related settings.
  - **`46(plugdev)`**: The **plugdev** group allows the user to manage hot-pluggable devices, such as USB drives.
  - **`101(lxd)`**: The **lxd** group is specific to systems with **LXD** (Linux Containers), and it allows the user to manage LXD containers.

These group memberships provide the "student" user with additional privileges and access to system resources, making it easier to perform administrative tasks and access certain hardware devices.

to return to the orginal shell  use `exit` and `id` to check for user identity 

Yes, that’s correct! On macOS, the admin user is not the same as the root user.

# 15.2.2 Executing Privileged Commands

The sudo command allows users to execute commands as another user. 

similer to the su commadn the root user is assumed by default 

```bash
sudo [options] command
```
This output is from the `/etc/shadow` file, which stores **encrypted passwords** and account-related information for users on a Linux or Unix-like system. Each line represents a user account, showing various fields related to password status and account configuration. Let’s break down the fields in this output:

### Understanding Each Field in `/etc/shadow`

Each line follows this format:

```
username:password:lastchanged:min:max:warn:inactive:expire
```

Here’s what each field means in your output:

1. **`username`**: The name of the account (e.g., `root`, `daemon`, `mail`, etc.).
2. **`password`**: Contains the encrypted password for the account. 
   - If there’s an asterisk (`*`) or an exclamation mark (`!`), it indicates that the account is **locked**, meaning the user cannot log in directly with a password.
   - In your case, each account has `*`, which means they are all locked and cannot be accessed directly.
3. **`lastchanged`**: The date (in days since January 1, 1970) when the password was last changed. For all accounts here, this is `19962`.
4. **`min`**: Minimum number of days required before the password can be changed again. A value of `0` means there is no minimum, so it can be changed at any time.
5. **`max`**: Maximum number of days the password is valid before it must be changed. Here, `99999` means the password never expires.
6. **`warn`**: Number of days before the password expires to warn the user. Here, `7` means the user will be warned 7 days before password expiration.
7. **`inactive`**: Number of days of inactivity after password expiration before the account is locked. This is often left blank (`::`) if not used.
8. **`expire`**: Absolute date when the account will be disabled, usually left blank (`::`) unless explicitly set.

### What These Accounts Are

The accounts listed (`root`, `daemon`, `bin`, `sys`, etc.) are **system accounts**, not regular user accounts. They exist to run specific system processes and services, each with its own permissions. Here’s a brief description of each:

- **`root`**: The superuser account with full access to all commands and files.
- **`daemon`**: Used for system daemons and background services, separate from root to limit security risks.
- **`bin`**: Typically used for system binaries and commands; historically associated with executable files.
- **`sys`**: Reserved for system-related processes.
- **`sync`**: Allows users to sync disks manually. Not commonly used in modern systems.
- **`games`**: Historically used for games; not often used today.
- **`man`**: Used by the manual pages system.
- **`lp`**: Stands for "line printer"; used for print services.
- **`mail`**: Used for the mail system.
- **`news`**: Used for the news server.

These accounts are usually locked (`*` in the password field) because they aren’t meant for interactive logins by users. Instead, they help manage permissions and run specific system services.

```bash
[sudo] password for student: 
root:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
bin:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
sys:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
sync:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
games:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
man:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
lp:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
mail:*:19962:0:99999:7:::
news:*:19962:0:99999:7:::

```
When using the sudo command to execute a command as the root user, the command prompts for the user's own password, not that of the root user

sudo commands less than five minutes apart.

The command is executed as `normal user` if it is not prefixed with the `sudo` command
