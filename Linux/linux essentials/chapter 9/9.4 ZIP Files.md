# 9.4 ZIP Files

useed in microsoft 

support in linux  by the `zip` and `unzip` commands 

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zip alpha_files.zip alpha*
  adding: alpha-first.txt (deflated 32%)
  adding: alpha-second.txt (deflated 36%)
  adding: alpha-third.txt (deflated 48%)
  adding: alpha.txt (deflated 53%)
  adding: alpha_files.tar.gz (stored 0%) 
```

It should be noted that tar requires the –f option to indicate a filename is being passed, while zip and unzip require a filename and therefore don’t need you to inform the command a filename is being passed.

The `zip` command will not recurse into subdirectories by default

if `tar` like behavior is needed then the `-r` option is used to add the subdirectories 

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ tree School                                     
School                                                                          
|-- Art                                                                         
|   `-- linux.txt                                                               
|-- Engineering                                                                 
|   `-- hello.sh                                                                
`-- Math                                                                        
    `-- numbers.txt                                                             
                                                                                
3 directories, 3 files    

```

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ zip -r School.zip School                        
  adding: School/ (stored 0%)                                                   
  adding: School/Art/ (stored 0%)                                               
  adding: School/Art/linux.txt (deflated 49%)                                   
  adding: School/Engineering/ (stored 0%)                                       
  adding: School/Engineering/hello.sh (deflated 88%)                            
  adding: School/Math/ (stored 0%)                                              
  adding: School/Math/numbers.txt (stored 0%)                                   
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents

```

## unzipping and listing files  

`unzip`

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ unzip -l School.zip                             
Archive:  School.zip                                                            
  Length      Date    Time    Name                                              
---------  ---------- -----   ----                                              
        0  2021-02-08 15:08   School/

       83  2021-02-08 15:08   School/Art/linux.txt

      740                     7 files              

```

tha unzip file will overide the files to avoid this mv it to new directory 

```bash

sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ mkdir tmp                                       
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cp School.zip  tmp/                             
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cd tmp/                                         
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents/tmp$ unzip School.zip                            
Archive:  School.zip                                                            
   creating: School/                                                            
   creating: School/Art/                                                        
  inflating: School/Art/linux.txt                                               
   creating: School/Engineering/                                                
  inflating: School/Engineering/hello.sh                                        
   creating: School/Math/                                                       
 extracting: School/Math/numbers.txt

directory component is simply one part of a path that points to a specific location with a file system hierarchy 

in paths directors and subdirectories are separated by slashes each section between slashes is considered a component. 


## Components in Relative vs. Absolute Paths

* Absolute Path: Starts from the root (/), and every part of the path is a component leading to a file or folder, like /home/user/Documents.

* Relative Path: Starts from the current directory and includes components relevant to that location, like Documents/Projects.

Each directory component is an essential "step" that defines how to reach a specific location within the directory structure.

### The examples below show three different attempts to extract a file.

First, just the name of the file is passed without the directory component. Like tar, the file is not matched.



to add a file to an existing archive use the r options


The original file is replaced with the zipped file using gzip bzip and xz 

but for `zip` form windows the orginal file remains
