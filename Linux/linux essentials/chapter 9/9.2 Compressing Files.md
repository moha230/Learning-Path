# 9.2 Compressing Files
 
* Compression reduces the amount of data needed to store or transmit files 


### compression algorithm

Is a procedure the computer uses to encode the original file

When talking about compression, there are two types:

* Lossless : No information is removed from the file 
compressing a file and decompressing it leaves something identical to the orginal.

* lossy : information might be removed from the file 
It is compressed in such a way that uncompressing a file will result in a file that is slightly different from the original 

examples an image with the same two shades of green maybe made smaller by treating the two shades the same 


Generally, human eyes and ears don’t notice slight imperfections in pictures and audio

*  lossy compression is beneficial to media because it results smaller file size and people can tell the difference 

> lossless compression is used for things that need to be intact like 

* documents 
* logs 
* software

> lossy compression is used mostly by 

* JPEG 

> lossless is used by 
* GIFS 
* PNG 

Compressing an already compressed file will not make it smaller.

## tools used in compression `gzip`

gzip g stands for GNU 


`gzip` is used to compress files to save space, and it typically produces files with a `.gz` extension.


## command for decompression 

`gunzip `

`g` stand for GNU 

`un` stands for unzipping 

`d` option that stand for decompress

```bash
gzip -d file.txt.gz
```


| Tool      | Algorithm            | File Extension |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------|
| `gzip`    | DEFLATE               | `.gz`         |
| `bzip2`   | Burrows-Wheeler (BWT) | `.bz2`        |
| `xz`      | LZMA (Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm) | `.xz` |
| `zip`     | DEFLATE               | `.zip`        |
| `7z`      | LZMA / LZMA2          | `.7z`         |
| `tar`     | No compression (archive only) | `.tar` |
| `tar.gz`  | DEFLATE (gzip + tar)  | `.tar.gz` or `.tgz` |
| `tar.bz2` | Burrows-Wheeler (bzip2 + tar) | `.tar.bz2` or `.tbz2` |
| `tar.xz`  | LZMA (xz + tar)       | `.tar.xz` or `.txz` |
| `rar`     | Proprietary (RAR algorithm) | `.rar` |
| `Zstandard (zstd)` | Zstandard     | `.zst`        |
| `lzop`    | LZO (Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer) | `.lzo` |
| `compress`| LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) | `.Z`          |
