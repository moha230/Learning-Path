# 9.3 Archiving Files

traditional unix utility to archive files is called tar

`TApe aRchive` it was used to stream many files to a tape for backups or file transfer 

The tar command takes in several files and creates a single outpt file that can be split up again into the original files.

The tar command has three modes 

* Create : makes a new archive out of a series of files.
* Extract: Pull one or more files out of an archive 
* List Show the content of the archive without extracting

# 9.3.1 Create Mode

```bash
tar -c [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS] [FILE...]
```

* `tar` create manage archives commands 
* `-c` stands for create 
* `-f` stands for file it specifies the name of the file you want to create without it tar would not know which file to write it. followed by the desired name `[ARCHIVE]` of the filename for the archive 

`[OPTIONS]` additional options to specify compression type verbosity and others 


`[FILE...]` files and directories you want to include in the archive 


tarball created from multiple files 

the tarball can be compressed using the `-z`option or `gzip` on the archive 

| Option | Function |
| :--------: | --------| 
| -z | Compress (or decompress) an archive using the gzip command.|

even though the file extension does not effect the file is treated when deciding a file name the convention is to use 

* `.tar` for tarballs 
* ` tar.gz` or `.tgz` for compressed tarballs 


`bzip2` compression 


# 9.3.2 List Mode

```bash
tar -t [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS]
```

`-t` list the files in an archive 
`-j` decompress with an bzip2 command 
`-f` operate on the given archive 

```bash 
tar -tjf folders.tbz
```

## output 

```
School/                                                                         
School/Art/                                                                     
School/Art/linux.txt                                                            
School/Engineering/                                                             
School/Engineering/hello.sh                                                     
School/Math/                                                                    
School/Math/numbers.txt

```

# 9.3.3 Extract Mode

```bash
tar -x [-f ARCHIVE] [OPTIONS]
```
This is when you take the files out of the tar archive and putting them back in the orginal format.

`-x` stands for extract 

`tar -xjf folder.tbz   `

Add the –v flag and you will get a verbose output of the files processed, making it easier to keep track of what's happening:

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~/Downloads$ tar -xjvf folders.tbz
School/
School/Engineering/
School/Engineering/hello.sh
School/Art/
School/Art/linux.txt
School/Math/
School/Math/numbers.txt
```
It is important to keep the –f flag at the end, as tar assumes whatever follows this option is a file name

The tar command has many more features, such as the ability to use patterns when extracting files, excluding certain files, or outputting the extracted files to the screen instead of disk. The documentation for tar has in-depth information.
