# Options

options are used with commands to expand or modify the way command behaves 

mnemonic easy to memorize and remember 

l = long list 
r = reverse 

what the hyphens mean the 

* single hyphens for short options this are typically one letter flags like -l or -r= reverse 

* double hyphens -- for long options this are used more for descriptive options like --recursive --help 

the hyphens signal to the shell that what follows are commands options rather than arguments like file name or directory. 

-h = --human-readable
