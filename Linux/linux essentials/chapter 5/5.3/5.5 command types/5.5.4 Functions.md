# 5.5.4 Functions


Functions can also be built using existing commands to either create new commands, or to override commands built-in to the shell or commands stored in files.

Functions are more advanced than aliases and typically are used in Bash shell scripts

```bash
function_name () 
{
   commands
}

```
