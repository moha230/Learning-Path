# 5.5.2 External Commands


External commands are binary executables stored in directories that are searched by the shell

ELF executable and Linkable format Used by linux and unix like systems 
PE portable executable used by windows
MAch o used by macos

Binary executables are compiled files that contain machine code ready for execution by the operating system. They are not human-readable, unlike source code, and are essential for running applications and system commands on computers.

In Unix-like operating systems, **external commands** are programs that are not built into the shell itself. Instead, they are separate executable files located in the filesystem. External commands can be run from the shell, and they typically perform a specific function or set of functions. Hereâ€™s a list of common external commands you might encounter:

### Common External Shell Commands

1. **File and Directory Management**
   - `ls`: Lists directory contents.
   - `cp`: Copies files and directories.
   - `mv`: Moves or renames files and directories.
   - `rm`: Removes files or directories.
   - `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
   - `rmdir`: Removes an empty directory.
   - `find`: Searches for files in a directory hierarchy.
   - `du`: Estimates file space usage.

2. **Text Processing**
   - `cat`: Concatenates and displays file content.
   - `more`: Views file content page by page.
   - `less`: Views file content with backward and forward navigation.
   - `head`: Displays the first few lines of a file.
   - `tail`: Displays the last few lines of a file.
   - `grep`: Searches for patterns in text files.
   - `sed`: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
   - `awk`: A programming language for pattern scanning and processing.

3. **System Information and Management**
   - `uname`: Displays system information.
   - `top`: Displays running processes in real-time.
   - `ps`: Displays currently running processes.
   - `df`: Displays disk space usage.
   - `free`: Displays memory usage.
   - `uptime`: Shows how long the system has been running.
   - `who`: Shows who is logged in.
   - `hostname`: Displays or sets the system's hostname.

4. **Networking**
   - `ping`: Tests network connectivity to a host.
   - `curl`: Transfers data from or to a server using various protocols.
   - `wget`: Retrieves files from the web.
   - `ifconfig`: Configures or displays network interface parameters.
   - `netstat`: Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
   - `traceroute`: Traces the path packets take to a network host.

5. **Archiving and Compression**
   - `tar`: Archives files into a single file (often with compression).
   - `zip`: Compresses files into a ZIP archive.
   - `unzip`: Extracts files from a ZIP archive.
   - `gzip`: Compresses files using the gzip format.
   - `gunzip`: Decompresses gzip-compressed files.

6. **User Management**
   - `useradd`: Creates a new user.
   - `usermod`: Modifies a user's account.
   - `userdel`: Deletes a user account.
   - `passwd`: Changes a user's password.

7. **Shell Scripting**
   - `bash`: The Bourne Again SHell, a popular command-line interpreter.
   - `sh`: The Bourne shell.
   - `zsh`: The Z shell, an extended Bourne shell with many improvements.

8. **Others**
   - `man`: Displays the manual page for a command.
   - `apropos`: Searches the manual page descriptions for a keyword.
   - `chmod`: Changes the file permissions.
   - `chown`: Changes the file owner and group.
   - `echo`: Displays a line of text.

### Notes
- External commands can vary by Unix-like operating systems (Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.), so some commands may not be available on all systems, or they may behave slightly differently.
- Many external commands have additional options and parameters that modify their behavior, which can be explored using the `man` command (e.g., `man ls`).

These commands provide a powerful set of tools for managing files, processing text, monitoring system performance, and more in a shell environment.
