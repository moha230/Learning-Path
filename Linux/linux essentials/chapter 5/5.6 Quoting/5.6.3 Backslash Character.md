# 5.6.3 Backslash Character

## \

>The service costs $1 and the path is $PATH 

if double quotes are used dollar symbol will cause the shell to consider them as variables 

if single quotes are used both symbol will not be considered variables 

if we ant the path to be treated as a variable we use backslash character in front of the doller sign
