.rpm file for each software package 

RPM makes use of an .rpm file for each software package. This system is what distributions derived from Red Hat, including Centos and Fedora, use to manage software. Several other distributions that are not Red Hat derived, such as SUSE, OpenSUSE, and Arch, also use RPM.
