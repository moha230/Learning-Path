Physically, a cloud can be described as computing resources from one or many off-site data centers which can be accessed over the internet. 

cloud models 

Public Cloud: A public cloud is a cloud infrastructure deployed by a provider to offer cloud services to the general public and organizations over the Internet. In the public cloud model, there may be multiple tenants (consumers) who share common cloud resources. More than likely, many of us have accessed public cloud resources at some point through providers such as Amazon, Google, and other popular public cloud providers.

Private Cloud: A private cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is set up for the sole use of a particular organization. When compared to a public cloud, a private cloud offers organizations a greater degree of privacy, and control over the cloud infrastructure, applications, and data. It can be hosted either on servers managed by the company that is using it or through a managed private cloud provider such as Rackspace or IBM.

Community Cloud: A community cloud is a cloud infrastructure that is set up for the sole use by a group of organizations with common goals or requirements. The organizations participating in the community typically share the cost of the community cloud service. This option may be more expensive than the public cloud; however, it may offer a higher level of control and protection against external threats than a public cloud.

Hybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is composed of two or more individual clouds, each of which can be a private, community, or public cloud. A hybrid cloud may change over time as component clouds join and leave. The use of such technology enables data and application portability. It also allows companies to leverage outside resources while retaining control of sensitive resources.
