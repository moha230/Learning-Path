3.2 Applications

kernel is like an air trafic controller at an airport 
the applications are the airplanes under its control 
the kernel choses which application get the block of memory 
it stats and kills applications 
it handles displaying text or graphics on a monitor 


application make request to the kernel and in return get receive resources such as memory CPUÂ nad disk space 


kernel abstract some complicated details away from the applications
the applications dont know if a block of disk is a solid state drive a spinning metal hard disk or even a network file share 
application need only follow the kernel application programming interface Applications 

Each application behaves as if it has large block of memory 

kernel maintains this illusion by remapping smaller blocks of memory sharing blocks of memory with other applications or even swapping out untouched blocks of disk .

kernel handles this switching fo applications called multitasking 


when user thiink of applications we tend to ttjink of word processors web browsers adn emails clients 

the kernal does not differentiate between a user facing appplication a network service that talks to a remote computer or an internal task 

form this we get an abstraction called processes

processes is just one task that is loaded and tracked by kernel
