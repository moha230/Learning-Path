Microsoft Exchange is shipped primarily as a software package/suite that includes all the necessary or approved components, all from Microsoft, so there are few if any options to make individual selections. In the open source world, many options can be modularly included or swapped out for package components, and indeed some software packages or suites are just a well-packaged set of otherwise individual components all harmoniously working together.
