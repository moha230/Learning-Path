3.2.2 Server Applications

the linux software falls into three categories 
- server applications 
- desktop applications 
- tools

-##server applications 
software that has no direct interaction with the monitor and keyboard of the machine it runs on ts purpose is to serve information to other computers, called clients. Sometimes server applications may not talk to other computers but only sit there and crunch data.

-##desktop applications 
thsi are software that the user enteract directly such as web browsers

-##tools 
software that is used to manage a computer 

Tools are software applications that help users manage, configure, and develop computer systems. Here are some examples of different types of tools:

1. System Management Tools:

Subversion (SVN): Another popular version control system used for managing project files over time.

8. Disk Management Tools:
GParted (Linux) or Disk Management (Windows): Tools to manage hard drive partitions and file systems.
CHKDSK (Windows): A tool to check and repair disk errors.

9. Text Editors:
Vim or Nano: Command-line text editors used to edit configuration files or code.
Notepad++: A lightweight GUI text editor often used for programming and system configuration.

10. Virtualization and Container Tools:
VirtualBox or VMware: Software that allows you to run virtual machines (VMs).
Docker: A tool for containerization, allowing you to package applications and their dependencies in isolated environments.

11. Monitoring Tools:
Nagios or Prometheus: Used to monitor system performance, uptime, and health of servers or networks.
Grafana: A tool for visualizing performance data from various monitoring sources.

12. Debugging Tools:
GDB (GNU Debugger): A debugger for programs written in C, C++, and other languages.
LLDB: The debugger that comes with LLVM, used for debugging code written in C, C++, and Objective-C.

13. Backup and Recovery Tools:
rsync (Linux): A command-line tool for synchronizing files and directories between different locations.
Time Machine (macOS): A tool for automated backups and recovery of files.
These tools help users, administrators, and developers manage systems, develop software, and keep everything running smoothly.


Evaluating application software is an important skill to be learned by the aspiring Linux administrator.

Dovecot: A popular IMAP and POP3 mail server used alongside Postfix for handling email storage and retrieval.
Exim: Another mail transfer agent commonly used on Linux systems for routing email.
Sendmail: One of the original MTAs, though less commonly used today due to its complexity.

4. File Servers
