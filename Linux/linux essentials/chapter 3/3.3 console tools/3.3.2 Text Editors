3.3.2 Text Editors

first text editor is vi or mordern one is vim and emacs

plugins can be either syntax high lighting of software projects to integrated calendars 

Both Vi and Emacs are complex and have a steep learning curve,

pico and nano are available on most systems and provide very basic text editing 

The Nano editor was developed as a completely open source editor that is loosely based on Pico, as the license for Pico is not an open source license and forbids making changes and distributing it.
