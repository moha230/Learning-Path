Open Source Initiative

The changes between GPLv2 and GPLv3 largely focused on using free software on a closed hardware device which has been coined Tivoization. TiVo is a company that builds a television digital video recorder on their own hardware and used Linux as the base for their software. While TiVo released the source code to their version of Linux as required under GPLv2, the hardware would not run any modified binaries. In the eyes of the FSF, this went against the spirit of the GPLv2, so they added a specific clause to version 3 of the license. Linus Torvalds agrees with TiVo on this matter and has chosen to stay with GPLv2.
