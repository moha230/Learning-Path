# 11.1 Introduction

# 11.2 Shell Scripts in a Nutshell

* shell script are files stored in a text file 
* files are run and each command is executed 
* they have acces to all the command of the shell 

Running a script can be done either by passing it as an argument to your shell or by running it directly

* _passing it as an argument_

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ sh test.sh
Hello, World!

```
in order to run a scripts you have to start with the shell your using either sh or bash or zsh etc


* _running it directly_

using the current directory and /  character will run the shell directly 


why is that when i a script is passed as anrguement it executes the file directly it does not till permmsions are set ?

When a script is **passed as an argument** to an interpreter (e.g., Python, Bash, or Node.js), the interpreter reads and executes the file, bypassing the need for the script itself to have execution permissions.

### **How It Works**
1. **Execution Without Permission**:
   - When you run something like `bash script.sh` or `python script.py`, you’re explicitly invoking the interpreter (`bash` or `python`) and passing the script file as an argument.
   - The interpreter itself is already an executable program with proper permissions.
   - It reads the contents of the file and executes the code. The operating system doesn't directly execute the script file, so it doesn't check for the script's execution permissions.

2. **Execution With Permission**:
   - When you attempt to execute the script directly, like `./script.sh`, the operating system treats the script as an executable program.
   - In this case, the file must have **execute permissions** (`chmod +x`), or you’ll get a "Permission denied" error.

### **Examples**
- **Without Execution Permission**:
    ```bash
    $ chmod -x script.sh  # Remove execution permission
    $ bash script.sh      # Works, because bash reads and executes the file
    $ ./script.sh         
    bash: ./script.sh: Permission denied  # Fails, since execute permission is missing
    ```

- **With Execution Permission**:
    ```bash
    $ chmod +x script.sh  # Add execution permission
    $ ./script.sh         # Works, because the OS can now execute the file directly
    ```

### **Why Passing Works Without Permissions**
When a script is passed to an interpreter, the system doesn’t need to execute the file itself. Instead:
- The interpreter (e.g., `bash` or `python`) reads the file as input and processes its contents.
- The execution permission is only required when running the script directly.

### **Conclusion**
Passing a script as an argument to an interpreter works without execution permissions because the interpreter is handling the execution, not the operating system. This distinction allows you to test and run scripts even if their permissions aren't set up for direct execution.

#  Step 5: Understanding the Path and ./

when we start with ./ we telling the computer that that to run the script from the current directory.

# Step 6: Using a Shebang (#!)

* shebang specifies the interpreter to use for the script

Purpose of Shebang:

* If you run a script directly (e.g., ./test.sh), the shebang determines the shell interpreter.

* If you explicitly pass the script to an interpreter (e.g., sh test.sh), the specified interpreter (sh) overrides the shebang.

# 11.3 Editing Shell Scripts

Command	Description
Ctrl + W	search the document
Ctrl + W, then Control + R	search and replace
Ctrl + G	show all the commands possible
Ctrl + Y/V	page up / down
Ctrl + C	show the current position in the file and the file’s size

# 11.4 Scripting Basics

Other than running commands, there are 3 topics you must become familiar with:

1. Variables, which hold temporary information in the script
2. Conditionals, which let you do different things based on tests you write
3. Loops, which let you do the same thing over and over.




# 11.4.1 Variables

1. Defining Variables
A variable in a shell script is created by assigning a value to a name using the = operator.
No spaces should appear around the =.


2. Accessing Variables
To use the value of a variable, prefix the variable name with a $.


4. Types of Variables
There are two main types of variables in shell scripts:

a. Local Variables
Variables defined within a script or function are accessible only in that scope.
b. Environment Variables
These are global variables that are inherited by any child process.
To define an environment variable, use the export command.



When you enclose a command in backticks (`command`), the shell executes the command first and replaces it with the output of that command. This process is called command substitution.

# 11.4.2 Conditionals

the if statment is the basic operator to implement branching 

```bash 

if pwd; then 
   echo pwd
fi 
```

The `test` common give you an easy access to comparison 


```bash
case "$variable" in
  pattern1)
    # Code to execute if $variable matches pattern1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    # Code to execute if $variable matches pattern2
    ;;
  *) same # * is as else matches everything 
    # Code to execute if no patterns match (default case)
    ;;
esac

```


# 11.4.3 Loops

Loops allow code to be executed repeatedly. They can be useful in numerous situations, such as when you want to run the same commands over each file in a directory, or repeat some action 100 times. There are two main loops in shell scripts: the for loop and the while loop.



# Indexed array
fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
echo "Indexed Array:"
echo "${fruits[0]}"  # apple
echo "${fruits[1]}"  # banana

# Associative array
declare -A capitals
capitals["USA"]="Washington, D.C."
capitals["France"]="Paris"
capitals["Japan"]="Tokyo"
echo "Associative Array:"
echo "USA: ${capitals["USA"]}"   # Washington, D.C.
echo "France: ${capitals["France"]}"  # Paris
