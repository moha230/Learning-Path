# 17.2 File Ownership

# File Ownership
- Files created by users are owned by them by default.
- Ownership can be changed, but this requires administrative privileges.
- The OS associates ownership with user IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs) rather than names internally.

# Group Ownership
- The group owner of a file is usually the user's primary group.
- Users can change the group ownership of their files to any group they belong to.
- Like user ownership, group ownership is managed internally by GIDs.

# Impact of UID/GID Changes
- Modifying a user's UID or deleting a user can result in files appearing to have no real owner, as the system displays the numeric UID instead of a username if no matching entry exists in `/etc/passwd`.
- The same behavior applies when a group is deletedâ€”showing the numeric GID instead of the group name.

# Using the `id` Command
- The `id` command helps verify the current user account and their group memberships.
- Its output includes:
  - The current user's UID and username.
  - The GID of the primary group and the group name.
  - Additional group IDs and names for all groups the user is a member of.

# Example of User and Group IDs
- The user has a **UID of 1001** for the user account `sysadmin`.
- The primary group for this user has a **GID of 1001** for the group `sysadmin`.

## User Private Group (UPG)
- When the user account and the primary group account share the same numeric identifier and name, it indicates that the user is in a **User Private Group (UPG)**.
- This means each user has a unique primary group that is created automatically upon the user account's creation.

## Supplemental Groups
- In the given example, the user `sysadmin` also belongs to four additional (supplemental) groups:
  - `adm` group with **GID 4**
  - `sudo` group with **GID 27**
  - `research` group with **GID 1005**
  - `development` group with **GID 1006**

## File Creation and Ownership
- When the user creates a file (e.g., using the `touch` command), the file will:
  - Have the user `sysadmin` as the **user owner**.
  - Have the group `sysadmin` as the **group owner**.

# File Ownership and Hidden Files
- **Hidden Files**: Files that begin with a period (`.`) are considered hidden in the system.
- **Listing Hidden Files**: Use the `-a` option with the `ls` command to list hidden files (e.g., `ls -a`).
- **Current and Parent Directories**:
  - The first two hidden files listed are:
    - `.`: Represents the current directory.
    - `..`: Represents the parent directory.
- **Listing Ownership of All Files**: 
  - Use the `ls -la` command to list all files and subdirectories, including hidden ones, along with their ownership and permissions.

# Understanding the `ls -l` Command Output
The `ls -l` command provides detailed information about files and directories. Here's what each part of the output means:

## Example Output:



### Breakdown of the Output:
- **Permissions (`-rw-rw-r--.`)**:
  - `-`: Indicates that this is a regular file (as opposed to a directory, denoted by `d`).
  - `rw-`: The owner (sysadmin) has read and write permissions.
  - `rw-`: The group (sysadmin) has read and write permissions.
  - `r--`: Other users have read-only permissions.
  - The trailing `.` indicates an SELinux context or other security attributes.

- **Number of Links (`1`)**:
  - Represents the number of hard links to the file.

- **User Owner (`sysadmin`)**:
  - The user who owns the file.

- **Group Owner (`sysadmin`)**:
  - The group that owns the file.

- **File Size (`0`)**:
  - The size of the file in bytes.

- **Date and Time (`Oct 21 10:18`)**:
  - The last modification date and time of the file.

- **File Name (`/tmp/filetest1`)**:
  - The name and path of the file.
