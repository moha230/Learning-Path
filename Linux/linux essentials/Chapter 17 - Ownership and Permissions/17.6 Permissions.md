# 17.6 Permissions

The output of the ls -l command displays ten characters at the beginning of each line. These characters indicate the type of file and the permissions of the file. For example, consider the output of the following command:

File type 

the first character indicates the type of file 

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4135 May 27 21:08 /etc/passwd
```

# File Type Characters in Linux

The following table describes the possible values for the file type character, which is the first character in the output of the `ls -l` command:

| Character | Type of File                                                                                                     |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-`       | A regular file, which may be empty or contain text or binary data.                                              |
| `d`       | A directory file, which contains the names of other files and links to them.                                    |
| `l`       | A symbolic link, a file name that refers (points) to another file.                                              |
| `b`       | A block file, related to a block hardware device where data is read in blocks of data.                          |
| `c`       | A character file, related to a character hardware device where data is read one byte at a time.                 |
| `p`       | A pipe file, allowing communication between processes, where the output of one process serves as input to another. |
| `s`       | A socket file, allowing two processes to communicate, with both processes able to send or receive data.         |


`Permission Groups`

the nine characters show the permissions of a file or directory 

the permission are grouped into three different roles 



User Owner

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4135 May 27 21:08 /etc/passwd
Characters 2-4 indicate the permissions for the user that owns the file. If you are the owner of the file, then only the user owner permissions are used to determine access to that file.

Group Owner

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4135 May 27 21:08 /etc/passwd
Characters 5-7 indicate the permissions for the group that owns the file. If you are not the owner but are a member of the group that owns the file, then only group owner permissions are used to determine access to that file.

Other Permissions

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 4135 May 27 21:08 /etc/passwd
Characters 8-10 indicate the permissions for others or what is sometimes referred to as the world's permissions. This group includes all users who are not the file owner or a member of the file's group.

`Permission Types`

Read `r`

this is the read permission there is an r character if the group has the read permission, or a - character if the group does not.

* On a file this allows processes to read the content of the file 
the content can be viewd and copied 
* On directory the files names can be listed but other details are not available 

Write `w`

write permission here is a w character if the group has the write permission, or a - character if the group does not.

* a file can be written by the proccess so changes can be saved 
not the w need r permission on the file to work correctly. 

* directory the file can be added or removed from the directory 
not that w permission requires x on the directory to work well 

Execute `x`

The third character of each group represents the execute permission. There is an x character if the group has the execute permission, or a - character if the group does not.

* a file can be executed or run as a proccess 
* on directory  the user can use the cd command to "get into" the directory and use the directory in a pathname to access files and, potentially, subdirectories under this directory.


# 17.7.6.1 Scenario #6 - Answer
Question: True or False: Based on the following information the user bob can successfully execute the following command: more /data/abc.txt?

Note that the /data directory has different user and group owners than the previous example
drwxr-xr-x. 17 root root 4096 23:38 /
dr-xr-x---. 10 bob  bob  128  03:38 /data
----rw-rwx.  1 bob  bob  100  21:08 /data/abc.txt
Answer: False.

Explanation: Recall that if you are the owner of a file, then the only permissions that are checked are the user owner permissions. In this case, that would be --- for bob on the /data/abc.txt file.

In this case, members of the bob group and "others" have more permissions on the file than bob has.

Lesson Learned: Don't provide permissions to the group owner and "others" without applying at least the same level of access to the owner of the file.


# 17.8 Changing Permissions

Summary
* Changing Permissions (chmod) adjusts who can access and perform operations on a file or directory (e.g., read, write, execute).
* Changing Ownership (chown/chgrp) alters who owns a file or directory and who belongs to a particular group associated with it.


change mode (chmod) used to change permisiions on file and directories 

we can use symbolic and numeric 

basic syntax 

```bash 
chmod new_permission file_name
```
> to change the file permission you either need to own the file or log in as the root user


# 17.8.1 Symbolic Method

# Permission Groups for `chmod`

| Character | Description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `u`       | User owner           |
| `g`       | Group owner          |
| `o`       | Others               |
| `a`       | All (user owner, group owner, and others) |

# Operators for Modifying Permissions

| Operator | Description                     |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `+`      | Add the specified permission(s) |
| `-`      | Remove the specified permission(s) |
| `=`      | Set the specified permission(s) exactly (overwrites existing permissions) |

# Permission Types for `chmod`

| Character | Description            |
|-----------|------------------------|
| `r`       | Read permission        |
| `w`       | Write permission       |
| `x`       | Execute permission     |


# 17.8.2 Numeric Method

The numeric method (also called the octal method) is useful when changing many permissions on a file. It is based on the octal numbering system in which each permission type is assigned a numeric value:

4 is read 
2 is write 
1 is execute 


0 = ---
1 = --x
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r--
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx


17.9 Default Permissions
The umask command is a feature that is used to determine default permissions that are set when a file or directory is created. Default permissions are determined when the umask value is subtracted from the maximum allowable default permissions. The maximum default permissions are different for files and directories:

file	rw-rw-rw-
directories	rwxrwxrwx
The permissions that are initially set on a file when it is created cannot exceed rw-rw-rw-. To have the execute permission set on a file, you first need to create the file and then change the permissions.

The umask command can be used to display the current umask value:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask
0002
A breakdown of the output:

The first 0 indicates that the umask is given as an octal number.
The second 0 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default user owner's permissions.
The third 0 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default group owner's permissions.
The last number 2 indicates which permissions to subtract from the default other's permissions.
Note that different users may have different umasks. Typically the root user has a more restrictive umask than normal user accounts:

root@localhost:~# umask
0022
To understand how umask works, assume that the umask of a file is set to 027 and consider the following:

File Default	666
Umask	-027
Result	640
The 027 umask means that new files would receive 640 or rw-r----- permissions by default, as demonstrated below:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch sample
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l sample
-rw-r-----. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Oct 28 20:14 sample
Because the default permissions for directories are different than for files, a umask of 027 would result in different initial permissions on new directories:

Directory Default	777
Umask	-027
Result	750
The 027 umask means that directories files would receive 750 or rwxr-x--- permissions by default, as demonstrated below:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir test-dir
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld test-dir
drwxr-x---. 1 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 28 20:25 test-dir
The new umask is only applied to file and directories created during that session. When a new shell is started, the default umask will again be in effect.

Permanently changing a user's umask requires modifying the .bashrc file located in that user's home directory.


### Understanding Default Permissions and the `umask` Command

**1. Default Permissions for Files and Directories:**
   - **Files**: The maximum default permission for files is `rw-rw-rw-` (666 in octal), which means the owner, group, and others have read and write permissions.
   - **Directories**: The maximum default permission for directories is `rwxrwxrwx` (777 in octal), which means full permissions for the owner, group, and others (read, write, and execute).

**2. Role of the `umask` Command:**
   - The `umask` command determines the default permissions set when a new file or directory is created. It effectively subtracts permissions from the maximum allowable defaults.
   - The `umask` value is shown as an octal number, where each digit specifies the permissions to be subtracted for the user owner, group owner, and others, respectively.

**3. How `umask` Works:**
   - The `umask` value is subtracted from the default permissions to determine the permissions on a new file or directory.
   - **Example**:
     - Default file permissions: `666` (rw-rw-rw-)
     - Umask: `027`
     - Resulting permissions: `640` (rw-r-----)
     - **Explanation**: The `umask` value `027` means:
       - The user owner’s permissions subtract `0` (no change).
       - The group owner’s permissions subtract `2` (write permission removed).
       - The other’s permissions subtract `7` (read, write, and execute removed).

**4. Example of `umask` in Action:**
   - **Setting `umask`**:
     ```bash
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ touch sample
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -l sample
     -rw-r----- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 0 Oct 28 20:14 sample
     ```
     This shows that the new file `sample` has `rw-r-----` permissions as a result of the `umask` value of `027`.

   - **Directories**:
     - **Default directory permissions**: `777` (rwxrwxrwx)
     - **Umask `027` applied**:
       - Resulting permissions: `750` (rwxr-x---)
     ```bash
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ umask 027
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ mkdir test-dir
     sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls -ld test-dir
     drwxr-x--- 1 sysadmin sysadmin 4096 Oct 28 20:25 test-dir
     ```
     The new directory `test-dir` has `rwxr-x---` permissions.

**5. Temporary vs. Permanent Changes:**
   - The `umask` command sets the mask for the current shell session. When you start a new shell session, the default `umask` is reapplied.
   - **Permanent Change**: To make a `umask` change persistent across all sessions, modify the `.bashrc` file in the user's home directory by adding the desired `umask` value:
     ```bash
     echo 'umask 027' >> ~/.bashrc
     ```
     After editing, run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart the shell for the change to take effect.

### Summary
- The `umask` command is used to set default permissions by subtracting permissions from the maximum allowable values for files and directories.
- The umask value is an octal number that determines which permissions are removed.
- Changes to `umask` only apply to files and directories created during that session. Permanent changes require editing configuration files like `.bashrc`.
