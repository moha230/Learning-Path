# 7.1 Introduction


files are used to store data such as text graphics and programs 

directories /folders are type of file used to store other files 

In any case, directories are used to provide a hierarchical organization structure.


# 7.2 Directory Structure
ectory structure called the file system 

Dir
![windows file system](https://ndg-content-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/linux-essentials-v2/LEv2_7_2.png)

* instead of my computer in linux we have the root directory 

* and its symbolized by the `/`sign character  

In the linux system there no drivers

# 7.2.1 Home Directory

![showing home directory](https://ndg-content-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/linux-essentials-v2/LEv2_7_4.png)

* its under the root directory 
* under the directory each user has its own directory  
* when user starts teh shell he should be placed in the home directory 
* as typically this is where they do most of their work.

This the only directory where the user has full control to create adn delet additional files and directories 

The owner and the admin can access the files 

the tilde symbole represents the home directory

# 7.2.3 Changing Directories

when the cd command is not used with any option then the cd commad send you back to the home directory


# 7.3 Paths

the argument to the cd command is more than just the name of the directory its actually the path.

a path is a kist of directories separated by / character 

If you think of the filesystem as a map, paths are the directory addresses, which include step-by-step navigation directions; they can be used to indicate the location of any file within the filesystem.

![path to user directory](https://ndg-content-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/linux-essentials-v2/LEv2_7_8.png)

Two types of files absolute and relative path 

# 7.3.1 Absolute Paths

This allows the user to specify the exact location of a directory. 

its always starts at the root directory thats why it begins with / character 

`/home/systadmin` is an absolute path 

* it tells the system to begin at the root / directory move into the home directory adn then into sysadmin

if the path /home/sysadmin is used as an argument to the cd command, it moves the user into the home directory for the sysadmin user.


# 7.3.2 Relative Paths

they start from the current directory 
the relative path gives the file location to a file relative to the current location in the file system 

the dont have / forward slash character instead they start with name of the directory contained within the current directory.

![navigating to the art file ](https://ndg-content-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/media/images/linux-essentials-v2/LEv2_7_10.png)


relative path 

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents$ cd /home/sysadmin/Documents/School/Art
sysadmin@localhost:~/Documents/School/Art$ 
```

single relative path 

pwd will print the absolute  path 

# 7.3.3 Shortcuts The .. Characters

.. represents the parent directory 

its moves you one level up the directory tree

moving from school to downloads 

```bash
cd ../../Downloads/
```

### The . Character

. represents the current directory 

For the cd this shortcut is not very useful, but it comes in handy for commands covered in subsequent sections.

# 7.4 Listing Files in a Directory


# 7.4.1 Listing Hidden Files

When the ls command is used to display the contents of a directory, not all files are shown automatically. The ls command omits hidden files by default. A hidden file is any file (or directory) that begins with a dot . character.

hidden files are customization files how linux works or program work 

.bashrc file in the home directory customizes features of the shell, such as creating or modifying variables and aliases.


# 7.4.2 Long Display Listing

Each file has details associated with it called metadata 

information such as the size, ownership, or timestamps

## File Type

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root   root  15322 Dec 10 21:33 alternatives.log                   
drwxr-xr-x 1 root   root   4096 Jul 19 06:52 apt 
```

* `-` represents reguler file 
* `d`  directory 
* `1` symbolic link points to another file 
* `s` socket communication between process 
* `pipe` allow communcation bewteeb process 
* `b` block file communicate with hardware 
* `c` character file communcate with hardware 

## Permissions
```bash

drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root   4096 Jul 19 06:51 journal
```
The next nine characters demonstrate the permissions of the file. Permissions indicate how certain users can access a file.

## Hard Link Coun


## User Owner

## Group Owner

# colors in linux 

| color    | type of color |
| -------- | ------- |
| black or white | reguler file    |
| Blue | Directory file    |
| Green   | Executable file (a program)  |

two hidden files exits . represents the current directories and .. represents the parent directory

?? represents character 

y using square brackets [ ] you can specify a single character to match from a set of characters. Execute the following command to display all of the files in the /etc directory that begin with the letters a, b, c or d:
