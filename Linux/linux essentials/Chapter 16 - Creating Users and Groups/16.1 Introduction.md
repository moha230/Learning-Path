# 16.1 Introduction

# 16.2.1 Creating A Group

written by the root user `groupadd` to create a new group 

`-g` option can be used to specify the group id for the new group 

# 16.2.1.1 Group ID Considerations


GID under 500 or 1000 are reserved for system use 
by using the `-r` option hich assigns the new group a GID that is less than the lowest standard GID:

# 16.2.1.2 Group Naming Considerations


Following these guidelines for group names can help to select a group name that is portable (function correctly with other systems or services):

The first character of the name should be either an underscore _ character or a lowercase alphabetic a-z character.
Up to 32 characters are allowed on most Linux distributions, but using more than 16 can be problematic as some distributions may not accept more than 16.
After the first character, the remaining characters can be alphanumeric, a dash - character or an underscore _ character.
The last character should not be a hyphen - character.

# 16.2.2 Modifying a Group

The groupmod command can be used to either change the name of a group with the -n option or change the GID for the group with the -g option.

# 16.2.3 Deleting a Group


If you decide to delete a group with the `groupdel` command, be aware that any files that are owned by that group will become orphaned.

# 16.3 Users

User account information is stored in the /etc/passwd file and user authentication information (password data) is stored in the /etc/shadow file.

# 16.3.1 User Configuration Files

`D`stand for default 
No problem! Let me explain in a simpler way. ðŸ˜Š

When you create a new user on a computer, that user needs to belong to a **group**. Think of groups as teams â€” they help decide what the user can or can't do on the computer.

### Two Ways It Can Work:
1. **With UPG (User Private Groups):**  
   - A new **team** is created just for that user.  
   - For example, if your username is `Ali`, the computer creates a group (team) also called `Ali`, and youâ€™re the only one in that team.

2. **Without UPG (No private teams):**  
   - Instead of making a new team for you, the computer puts you in a **shared team**.  
   - This team is usually called `users`, and lots of people can be in it together.  
   - By default, this team has the number **100** (called GID or Group ID).

So, if your computer doesnâ€™t make private teams (no UPG), it puts everyone into the same team called `users` unless you tell it otherwise.

### Why is this important?  
Groups help manage things like:
- Who can open certain files.
- Who can use specific programs.

If you're 12, think of it like this:  
- A group is like a class in school.  
- UPG makes a new class just for you (private).  
- No UPG puts you in a big class with others (shared).  



The `-g` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different primary group than the default when creating a new user account.

The `-b` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different base directory group than the default when creating a new user account.

he `-f` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different INACTIVE value than the default when creating a new user account.

The `-e` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different EXPIRE value than the default when creating a new user account.

The `-s` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different login shell than the default when creating a new user account.

The SKEL value determines which skeleton directory has its contents copied into the new userâ€™s home directory. The contents of this directory are copied into the new user's home directory, and the new user is given ownership of the new files.

The `-k` option to the useradd command allows you to use a different SKEL directory than the default when creating a new user account.

To modify one of the useradd default values, the /etc/default/useradd file could be edited with a text editor. Another (safer) technique is to use the useradd -D command.

For example, if you wanted to allow users to have expired passwords that they could still log in with for up to thirty days, then you could execute:

# 16.3.2 User Configuration Files

In **Ubuntu** and **macOS**, user configuration files typically refer to hidden files located in the home directory (denoted as `~`). These files store user-specific settings for various applications and environments. Below is how you can locate and manage these configuration files.

---

### **Common User Configuration Files**
| Filename            | Purpose                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `.bashrc`           | Configuration for Bash shell (aliases, functions).|
| `.zshrc`            | Configuration for Zsh shell (if Zsh is used).    |
| `.profile`          | Login shell configuration.                       |
| `.gitconfig`        | Git user-specific configurations.                |
| `.ssh/config`       | SSH client configuration.                        |
| `.vimrc` or `.vim`  | Vim editor configuration.                        |
| `.config/`          | Directory for various application configurations.|
| `.env`              | Environment variables for various tools.         |

---

### **Location of Configuration Files**

1. **In Ubuntu and macOS:**
   - User configuration files are located in the **home directory** (`~`).
   - Use the following command to list all hidden configuration files:

     ```bash
     ls -la ~
     ```

     This will show files prefixed with a dot (`.`), which makes them hidden by default.

---

### **Accessing Specific Files**

- **Bash Shell Configuration:**
  ```bash
  nano ~/.bashrc
  ```
- **Git Configuration:**
  ```bash
  nano ~/.gitconfig
  ```
- **SSH Configuration:**
  ```bash
  nano ~/.ssh/config
  ```

- **Zsh Shell (macOS default shell from Catalina onwards):**
  ```bash
  nano ~/.zshrc
  ```

---

### **Differences Between Ubuntu and macOS**
- Both systems follow similar standards for configuration file placement.
- macOS may include additional macOS-specific files, such as:
  - `.DS_Store` (used for Finder metadata).
  - `~/Library/Preferences/` directory for app preferences.
  
Ubuntu often uses the `.config/` directory more extensively for desktop apps.

The format you've provided seems like it could be related to a configuration file or command involving user settings, possibly related to user authentication or password aging. However, without specific context, it's difficult to say for sure what system or configuration it pertains to. 

Based on common structures in Unix/Linux systems, this could be a line from the `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow` file, or it could relate to a user account configuration for password aging and restrictions. Here's a breakdown of a common structure for password aging in `/etc/shadow`:

```
username:password:lastchg:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:
```

### Explanation of Each Part:
- **`username`**: The name of the user (e.g., `bob`).
- **`password`**: The hashed password or a placeholder (e.g., `pw` could be a placeholder for an actual password hash).
- **`lastchg`**: The number of days since the password was last changed.
- **`min`**: The minimum number of days required between password changes.
- **`max`**: The maximum number of days the password is valid.
- **`warn`**: The number of days before the password expires that the user is warned.
- **`inactive`**: The number of days after the password expires until the account is disabled.
- **`expire`**: The date (in days since January 1, 1970) when the account will be disabled. 

### Breaking Down Your Example:
```
bob:pw:15020:5:30:7:60:15050:
```

- **`bob`**: The username.
- **`pw`**: Placeholder for the password hash (or may indicate a password status).
- **`15020`**: Days since the password was last changed.
- **`5`**: Minimum number of days required between password changes.
- **`30`**: Maximum number of days the password is valid before expiration.
- **`7`**: Number of days before expiration when the user is warned.
- **`60`**: Number of days after the password expires before the account is disabled.
- **`15050`**: Date (in days since January 1, 1970) when the account will expire, or it could mean an expiration timestamp in a different format.

### Possible Contexts:
1. **`/etc/shadow` File**: A file where password and account aging information are stored for user accounts in Unix/Linux.
2. **Custom Configuration**: A line from a script or custom configuration file managing user account policies.

fahad1:pwd:20038:0:99999:7:::

username:password hash : lastchg:min:max:warn:inactive

The user fahad1 has a password set (though it appears as a placeholder pwd).
The password was last changed 20038 days after January 1, 1970.
There is no minimum number of days between password changes (0).
The password does not expire (99999).
The user will receive a warning 7 days before the password expires.
The account does not have an inactivity period or an expiration date.

`PASS_MIN_DAYS	0`

have the ability to change the password they have at any time 

if set for 3 days the user has to wait for three days in order to change the password 

`PASS_MIN_LEN	5`

indicate the minimum number of character that a password must contain 


`PASS_WARN_AGE	7`

warns the user to change there password this the maximum days the user will start gettin warning to change there passwords

`UID Minimum`

it determins the first uid user identifier 

any uid less than 500 when be assigned to system account or root account 

`UID_MAX`

the maximum user identifier in the system 

`GID_MIN`

it determines the first GID group identifier 

any GID less the 500 would either be system group or a root group 

```text
Common UIDs:
UID 0: Reserved for the root user, which has full administrative privileges and control over the system.
UID 1-999: Often reserved for system users and services.
UID 1000 and above: Typically assigned to regular users.
```

`GID_MAX	`

A GID, like a UID, could have a value of over four billion. Whatever value you use for your UID_MAX, should be used for GID_MAX to support UPG.

WHATS `UPG` stand for User and group ID presistance and growth 

Explanation:
In Unix and Linux, UID (User ID) and GID (Group ID) are 32-bit numbers, allowing them to have a maximum value of over four billion (2^32 - 1).
Traditionally, systems have used a smaller range for UIDs and GIDs, such as 0-65535 (16-bit), which limits the number of users and groups the system can manage.
UPG ensures that the system can handle larger UIDs and GIDs, allowing for more flexibility and scalability in managing users and groups.


`Umask`

it deterimines the default permessions

# 16.3.3 Account Considerations

Valid Usernames:
user1: Starts with a lowercase alphabetic character, followed by alphanumeric characters.
_username: Starts with an underscore and followed by alphanumeric characters.
john_doe: Contains lowercase letters and an underscore.
alice123: Starts with a lowercase letter and contains numbers.
user-name: Contains lowercase letters and a dash.

Invalid Usernames:
1user: Starts with a number, which is not allowed.
username!: Contains a character ! that is not allowed.
user-name-: Ends with a hyphen, which is not allowed.
this_is_a_very_long_username_exceeding_32_characters: More than 32 characters long, which may be problematic on some distributions.
UserName: Starts with an uppercase letter, which is not allowed.

`User Identifier (UID)`

-u stand for userid this option is used to set the user id of the new user 
The root user has a UID of 0, which allows that account to have special privileges. Any account with a UID of 0 would effectively be able to act as the administrator.


he reserved range used for service accounts has expanded over time. Initially, it was for UIDs between 1 and 99. Then, it expanded to be between 1 and 499. The current trend among distributions is that system accounts are any account that has a UID between 1 and 999, but the range 1-499 is also still commonly used.

When setting up a new system, it is a good practice to start UIDs no lower than 1000 ensuring there are sufficient UIDs available for many system services and giving you the ability to create many GIDs in the reserved range

`primary group`

distributions which feature UPG group is created automaticlly with  A GID and group name that matches UID and the username of the newly created user account 

when we dont use UPG the primary group ordinarily default to the users group with GID 100

To specify a primary group with the useradd command, use the -g option with either the name or GID of the group

`Supplementary Group`

The error message useradd: user 'jane' already exists indicates that a user with the username jane already exists in the system. The useradd command is used to create new user accounts, not to modify existing ones. If the user already exists and you want to add them to new supplementary groups, you should use the` usermod `command instead.


if only the user does not exists

`root@localhost:~# useradd -G sales,research jane`

`Home Directory`
By default, most distributions create the user's home directory with the same name as the user account underneath whichever base directory is specified in the HOME


If CREATE_HOME is set to no or this setting is not present, then the directory will not be created automatically. Otherwise, the `-M `option is used to specify to the useradd command that it should not create the home directory, even if CREATE_HOME is set to yes.

If the CREATE_HOME setting in the /etc/login.defs file is set to yes, the home directory is created automatically. Otherwise, the -m option can be used to make the home directory.

The `-b` option allows you to specify a different base directory under which the user's home directory is created. For example, the following creates the user account jane with a /test/jane created as the userâ€™s home directory:

The `-d `option allows you to specify either an existing directory or a new home directory to create for the user. This should be a full path for the user's home directory. For example, the following creates the user account jane with a /test/jane created as the userâ€™s home directory:

The `-k` option to specifies a different skeleton directory. When using the -k option, the -m option is required.

`command option skelton_diretcory path new user`
`useradd -km /home/sysadmin kaka`


`Shell`


While the default shell is specified in the /etc/default/useradd file, it can also be overridden with the useradd command using the -s option at the time of account creation:

`Comment`
The comment field, originally called the General Electric Comprehensive Operating System (GECOS) field

root@localhost:~# useradd -c 'Jane Doe' jane 

# 16.3.4 Creating a User


Once you've verified which default values to use and you've gathered the information about the user, then you are ready to create a user account. An example of a useradd command using a few options looks like the following:

root@localhost:~# useradd -u 1009 -g users -G sales,research -m -c 'Jane Doe' jane 
This example of the useradd command creates a user with a UID of 1009, a primary group of users, supplementary memberships in the sales and research groups, a comment of "Jane Doe", and an account name of jane.

`
Once you've verified which default values to use and you've gathered the information about the user, then you are ready to create a user account. An example of a useradd command using a few options looks like the following:

```bash
root@localhost:~# useradd -u 10012 -g users -G sales,research -m -c "alice Doe" 
alice  
```

# 16.3.5 Passwords

There are numerous factors to consider when you are trying to choose a password for an account:


If an account is not being used, then it can automatically be disabled when the password is no longer valid.
If attackers are attempting a "brute-force" attack by trying every possible password, then the password can be changed before the attack can succeed.
However, requiring a user to change their password too often might pose security problems, including:

The quality of the password the user chooses might suffer.
The user may start writing their password on paper, increasing the possibility that the password may be discovered.
Seldom used user accounts may become expired and require administrative attention to reset.
Opinions vary about how often users should be forced to change their passwords. For highly-sensitive accounts, it is recommended to change passwords more frequently, such as every 30 days. On the other hand, for non-critical accounts without any access to sensitive information, there is less need for frequent change. For accounts with minimal risk, having a duration of 90 days would be considered more reasonable.

# 16.3.5.1 Setting a User Password

we can use the `passwd` command 

# 16.3.5.2 Managing Password Aging

change age  = chage is command to control password

The chage command provides many options for managing the password aging information found in the /etc/shadow file.

Here's a summary of the chage options:

Short Option	Long Option	Description
-l	--list	List the account aging information
-d LAST_DAY	--lastday LAST_DAY	Set the date of the last password change to LAST_DAY
-E EXPIRE_DATE	--expiredate EXPIRE_DATE	Set account to expire on EXPIRE_DATE
-h	--help	Show the help for the chage command
-I INACTIVE	--inactive INACTIVE	Set account to permit login for INACTIVE days after password expires
-m MIN_DAYS	--mindays MIN_DAYS	Set the minimum number of days before the password can be changed to MIN_DAYS
-M MAX_DAYS	--maxdays MAX_DAYS	Set the maximum number of days before a password should be changed to MAX_DAYS
-W WARN_DAYS	--warndays WARN_DAYS	Set the number of days before a password expires to start displaying a warning to WARN_DAYS


# 16.3.6 Modifying a User

both `who`and `w`command display who is currenly logged into the system 

the `w`command is more verbose of the two it shows system uptime and load infromation 

Both the who and the w commands display who is currently logged into the system. The w command is the more verbose of the two, as it shows the system's uptime and load information as well as what process each user is running. The last command can be used to determine current and previous login sessions as well as their specific date and time. By providing a username or a tty (terminal) name as an argument, the command only shows records that match that name.

The usermod command offers many options for modifying an existing user account. Many of these options are also available with the useradd command at the time the account is created. The following chart provides a summary of the usermod options:

Short Option	Long Option	Description
-c	COMMENT	Sets the value of the GECOS or comment field to COMMENT.
-d HOME_DIR	--home HOME_DIR	Sets HOME_DIR as a new home directory for the user.
-e EXPIRE_DATE	--expiredate EXPIRE_DATE	Set account expiration date to EXPIRE_DATE.
-f INACTIVE	--inactive INACTIVE	Set account to permit login for INACTIVE days after password expires.
-g GROUP	--gid GROUP	Set GROUP as the primary group.
-G GROUPS	--groups GROUPS	Set supplementary groups to a list specified in GROUPS.
-a	--append	Append the user's supplemental groups with those specified by the -G option.
-h	--help	Show the help for the usermod command.
-l NEW_LOGIN	--login NEW_LOGIN	Change the user's login name.
-L	--lock	Lock the user account.
-s SHELL	--shell SHELL	Specify the login shell for the account.
-u NEW_UID	--uid NEW_UID	Specify the user's UID to be NEW_UID.
-U	--unlock	Unlock the user account.
Several of these options are worthy of discussion because of how they impact user management. It can be very problematic to change the user's UID with the -u option, as any files owned by the user will be orphaned. On the other hand, specifying a new login name for the user with -l does not cause the files to be orphaned.

Deleting a user with the userdel command can either orphan or remove the user's files on the system. Instead of deleting the account, another choice is to lock the account with the -L option for the usermod command. Locking an account prevents the account from being used, but ownership of the files remains.

There are some important things to know about managing the supplementary groups. If you use the -G option without the -a option, then you must list all the groups to which the user would belong. Using the -G option alone can lead to accidentally removing a user from all the former supplemental groups that the user belonged to.

If you use the -a option with -G then you only have to list the new groups to which the user would belong. For example, if the user jane currently belongs to the sales and research groups, then to add her account to the development group, execute the following command:

# 16.3.7 Deleting a User

without deleting the home directory 

userdel jane


To delete the user, home directory, and mail spool as well, use the -r option:

r stand for remove
