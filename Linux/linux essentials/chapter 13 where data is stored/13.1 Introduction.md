# 13.1 Introduction

An implementation of the Linux kernel includes many subsystems that are a part of the kernel itself and others that may be loaded in a modular fashion when needed

key function of the linux kernal 

* system call interface 
* process management 
* memory management 
* virtual filesystem 
* networking
* device drivers


Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

It is important to understand the role of the Linux kernel and how it both processes and provides information about the system under the /proc and /sys pseudo filesystems.

1. /proc Filesystem:

The /proc directory is a virtual filesystem that provides a view of the kernel's internal data structures
t doesnâ€™t contain real files but rather dynamic files that represent information about the running system.

2. /syst filesystem 

The files in /sys are not real files stored on disk but are dynamically created by the kernel.
Reading from these files retrieves information about hardware or kernel subsystems.
