# 10.5 Viewing File Statistics

wc stand for word count 

_basic syntx 

```bash 
wc [options] [file...]
```

Common options:
-l: Prints the number of lines.
-w: Prints the number of words.
-c: Prints the number of bytes (characters).
-m: Prints the number of characters (this is different from bytes in some encodings).
-L: Prints the length of the longest line.

(1 byte = 1 character in a text file)

command allows for up to three statistics to be printed for each file provided, as well as the total of these statistics if more than one filename is provided:

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ wc /etc/passwd /etc/passwd-
  35   56 1710 /etc/passwd
  34   55 1665 /etc/passwd-
  69  111 3375 total    

```

The output of the previous example has four columns:

Number of lines
Number of words
Number of bytes
File name

using `-l`option shows the number of lines 
using `-w` options to show just the number of words 
uinsg `-c`option to show the number bytes
