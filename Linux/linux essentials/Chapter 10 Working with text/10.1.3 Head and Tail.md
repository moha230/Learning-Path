# 10.1.3 Head and Tail

The `head` and `tails`commands are used to display only the first fw or last few lines ofa file.

by default the head and tail command display ten lines of teh file that is provided as ana argument 

Passing a number as an option will cause both the head and tail commands to output the specified number of lines, instead of the standard ten. For example to display the last five lines of the /etc/sysctl.conf file use the -5 option:


The -n option can also be used to indicate how many lines to output. Pass a number as an argument to the option:


## Negative Value Option

Traditionally in UNIX, the number of lines to output would be specified as an option with either command, so -3 meant to show three lines. For the tail command, either -3 or -n -3 still means show three lines.

GNU version of the head command -n -3 as show all but the last three lines 

but the head command still recognizes the option -3 as show the first three lines. 

## Positive Value Option

The GNU version of the tail command allows for a variation of how to specify the number of lines to be printed.

If the -n option is used with a number prefixed by the plus sign, then the tail command recognizes this to mean to display the contents starting at the specified line and continuing all the way to the end.

the live files changes can be used by the -f option command to the tail command usefyl when you want to see changes to a file as they are happening.
