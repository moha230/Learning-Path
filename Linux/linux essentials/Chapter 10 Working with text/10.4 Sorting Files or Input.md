# 10.4 Sorting Files or Input

The sort command can be used to rearrange the lines of files or input in either dictionary or numeric order. The following example creates a small file, using the head command to grab the first 5 lines of the /etc/passwd file and send the output to a file called mypasswd.

```bash 
sort [options] [file...]

```

### Common sort Command Options:

1. Sort in ascending order (default):

sort file.txt

2. Sort in descending order: Use the -r flag to sort in reverse (descending) order:

sort -r file.txt

3. Sort numerically: The -n flag is used to sort numbers, which can be useful if your source code includes numbers (e.g., line numbers or versions).

```bash
sort -n file.text
```

4. Sort by a specific column (field): If your file contains data organized into columns (e.g., space-separated or tab-separated values), you can sort by a specific column using the -k flag. For example, sorting by the second column:
sort -k2 file.txt

5. Sort ignoring case: Use the -f flag to perform case-insensitive sorting:
sort -f file.txt

6. Sort with a delimiter: The -t flag allows you to specify a custom delimiter for columns, such as a comma or tab:
sort -t',' -k2 file.csv
This will sort a CSV file by the second column.

7. Sort by month or date: If your data contains dates in a format like Jan 10, you can sort it with the -M option:
sort -M file.txt

8. Sort with unique values: The -u flag is used to remove duplicates while sorting:
sort -u file.txt



# 10.4.1 Fields and Sort Options

In computing, a delimiter is a character that separates a string of text or data; it defaults to whitespace, like spaces or tabs.



Option	Function
-t,	Specifies the comma character as the field delimiter
