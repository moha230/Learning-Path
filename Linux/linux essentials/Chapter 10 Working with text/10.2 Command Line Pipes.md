# 10.2 Command Line Pipes

`|`sends the output of one command to another.

when command has output or generates an error 

when views large files the pipe command can be used 

```bash 
ls /etc | head
```

The full output of the ls command is passed to the head command by the shell instead of being printed to the screen. The head command takes this output from the ls command as input data, and the output of head is then printed to the screen.

multiple pipes can be used consecutively to link multiple commands together. 

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /etc/ssh | nl
     1  moduli
     2  ssh_config
     3  ssh_host_ecdsa_key
     4  ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub
     5  ssh_host_ed25519_key
     6  ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub
     7  ssh_host_rsa_key
     8  ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
     9  ssh_import_id
    10  sshd_config

```
