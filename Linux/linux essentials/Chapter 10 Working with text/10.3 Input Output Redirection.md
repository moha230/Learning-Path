# 10.3 Input/Output Redirection

* Input and output redirection allows for command line information to be passed to different streams. 

* what are streams 

* sequence of data elements made available over time used to manage and process data more effeciently 

* Useful when dealing with large datasets or continuous data like real-time data from the sensors.

_standard streams_
 
 ### STDIN

`Standard input`, or STDIN information entered normally by the user via keyboard 
when the shell prompts the user for data shell provides the user with the ability to type commands that in turn are sent to the `STDIN`

 ### STDOUT
`Standard output`or STDOUT is the normal output of commands 
This is displayed in the terminal windows `STDOUT` is aslo known as stream of channel #1


### STDERR

* Standard error or STDERR is error messages generated by commands by default 
* its displayed by in the terminal window where the command is executing 
* its also known as stream or channel #2

I/O redirection allows the user to redirect STDIN so that data comes from a file and STDOUT/STDERR so that output goes to a file.

its achieved using < >

# 10.3.1 STDOUT

this can be directed to files Using the > character, the output can be redirected to a file instead:

The standard out can be redirected by using single greater than and double greater than operator 
The single greater than tend to override the content of the file and the double greater than operator tends to append the information or standard output  

# 10.3.2 STDERR


what is standrad error 

```bash
find /etc -type f 2> /dev/null

find /etc -type f 1> ~/results.txt 2> ~/errors.txt
```

if you use `echo$?` it tells you the code of the standard out or error that has been executed 

# 10.3.3 Redirecting Multiple Streams

its possible to direct `STDOUT` and `STDERR` of a command at the same time.

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /fake /etc/ppp > example.txt
ls: cannot access /fake: No such file or directory
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat example.txt
/etc/ppp:
ip-down.d
ip-up.d
```

its possible to choose which standout or error is printed in the screen by speciyfiing the number before teh greater than symbole.  

`&` by using the ampersand character in front of the greater than character it means both 1 and 2 standard out put and error respectively are redirected to the file specified 

Note that when you use &>, the output appears in the file with all of the STDERR messages at the top and all of the STDOUT messages below all STDERR messages:


If you don't want STDERR and STDOUT to both go to the same file, they can be redirected to different files by using both > and 2>. For example, to direct STDOUT to example.txt and STDERR to error.txt execute the following:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls /fake /etc/ppp > example.txt 2> error.txt
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat error.txt
ls: cannot access /fake: No such file or directory
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat example.txt
/etc/ppp:
ip-down.d
ip-up.d

```

The order in which the streams are specified does not matter.

# 10.3.4 STDIN

`tr ` stand for translate 


```bash
student@le24srv:~$ tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
watch how this works 
WATCH HOW THIS WORKS 
```

tr command does not support file name arguments:

It is possible, however, to tell the shell to get STDIN from a file instead of from the keyboard by using the < character:

`<` symbol or character is used to take inputs from a file and into the command 

When you use the < symbol in a command, it redirects the contents of a file into the command's input stream.

THis tell the shell to take the standard input from a file but not keyboard 

```bash 
student@le24srv:~$ tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' < example.text > translatedExample.txt
student@le24srv:~$ cat translatedExample.txt 
/ETC/PPP:
IP-DOWN.D
IP-UP.D
student@le24srv:~$ 

```


To redirect both standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to one file, first redirect stdout to a file and then redirect stderr to that same file by using the notation 2>&1.

find /etc -name hosts > find.out 2>&1
cat find.out
Your output should be similar to the following:

sysadmin@localhost:~$ find /etc -name hosts > find.out 2>&1                   
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cat find.out                                              
/etc/hosts                                                                      
find: '/etc/ssl/private': Permission denied    
sysadmin@localhost:~$
The 2>&1 part of the command means "send the stderr (channel 2) to the same place where stdout (channel 1) is going".
