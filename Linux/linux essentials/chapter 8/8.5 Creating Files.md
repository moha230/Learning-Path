# 8.5 Creating Files

There is also a way to create an empty file that can be populated with data at a later time. This feature is useful for some operating systems as the very existence of a file could alter how a command or service works. It is also useful to create a file as a "placeholder" to remind you to create the file contents at a later time.

To create an empty file, use the touch command as demonstrated below:

>`touch`

Notice the size of the new file is 0 bytes. As previously mentioned, the touch command doesn't place any data within the new file.


The `touch` command in Unix/Linux has two primary uses:

1. **Create New Empty Files**:
   - You can use `touch` to quickly create a new, empty file if it doesn’t already exist. For example:
     ```bash
     touch newfile.txt
     ```
   - This will create `newfile.txt` in the current directory if it doesn’t exist.

2. **Update Timestamps of Existing Files**:
   - `touch` can update the **modification** and **access** timestamps of an existing file to the current date and time, or to a specified time. For example:
     ```bash
     touch existingfile.txt
     ```
   - This command doesn’t change the contents of the file—only its timestamps. It’s useful for tracking when files were last accessed or modified.

If you want to set a specific timestamp, you can use the `-t` option:

```bash
touch -t YYYYMMDDHHMM.SS file.txt
```

This command sets the modification time to a custom date and time.
