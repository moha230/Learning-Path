# 8.6 Removing Files

to delete all files we use `rm` command 

```bash
rm filename 
```

when using the rm command the is no warning or message from the shell especially when using the glob characters 


> Warning
The files are permanently deleted. There is no command to undelete a file and no trash can from which to recover deleted files.


 --------
| options | Meaning |
| ---------|  --------|
|  -i    | interactive Ask if a file is to be overwritten.|
|  -n  | No Clobber: Do not overwrite a destination file's |contents.|
| -v | Verbose: Show the resulting move.|

As a precaution, users should use the `-i` option when deleting multiple files:

# 8.6.1 Removing Directories

The rm command does not delete directories 

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm Videos/                                                
rm: cannot remove 'Videos/': Is a directory 
```

To delete a directory with the rm command, use the -r recursive option:

> When a user deletes a directory, all of the files and subdirectories are deleted without any interactive question. It is best to use the -i option with the rm command.

```bash 
sysadmin@localhost:~$ rm -ri Videos/                                            
rm: descend into directory 'Videos/'? y                                         
rm: remove regular file 'Videos/hosts'? y                                       
rm: remove regular file 'Videos/myText.txt'? y                                  
rm: remove directory 'Videos/'? y                                               
sysadmin@localhost
```

The other way we can delete a directory is with 

### `rmdir`
