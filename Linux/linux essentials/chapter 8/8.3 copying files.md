# 8.3 Copying Files

The cp command is an external command and used to copy file 

it requires a source and destination 

```bash
cp [options] source destination
```

The -p option in the cp command is used to preserve the attributes of the files when copying. This includes the original file's:

Timestamps (modification and access times),
Ownership (user and group),
Permissions (read, write, execute).
Using -p helps maintain the exact properties of the original file, which is especially useful in situations where file metadata is important, like backups or server migrations.



# 8.3.1 Verbose Mode

#### what is verbose meaning 

Plain english : 

Using more word than necessary 

The -v option causes the cp command to produce output if successful . 


 ```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp  -v /etc/hosts ~                                       
'/etc/hosts' -> '/home/sysadmin/hosts'                                          
sysadmin@localhost
 ```

 when the destination is a directory the resulting file keeps the same name as the orginal name  

 if the user wants to give the destination file a new name its added as part of the destination 

 ```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp -v /etc/hosts ~/host.copy                              
'/etc/hosts' -> '/home/sysadmin/host.copy'                                      
sysadmin@localhost:~$ ls                                                        
Desktop    Downloads  Pictures  Templates  host.copy                            
Documents  Music      Public    Videos     hosts                                
sysadmin@localhost:ost

 ```
 **Source**

|`/etc/hosts'|-> `hosts'

**Target**

`/etc/hosts'-> `hosts'

 # 8.3.2 Avoid Overwriting Data

 if the file exists in the destination folder the `cp` command tends to overwrites the existing files content with the content of the source file 

side notes 

in order to find a file path we use `realpath`

Two options can be used to safeguard against accidental overwrites. 

with the `i` interactive option 

This allows the prompts the user before overwriting a file 

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp -i /etc/hostname example.text                          
cp: overwrite 'example.text'? y                                                 
```

The -i option requires you to answer y or n for every copy that could end up overwriting an existing file's contents

The -i option requires you to answer y or n for every copy that could end up overwriting an existing file's contents. This can be tedious when a bunch of overwrites occur, such as the example demonstrated below:

To answer n to each prompt automatically, use the -n option. It stands for no clobber, or no overwrite.

# 8.3.3 Copying Directories

by default the cp command will not copy any directory any attempt to do so results in an error message

By default, cp is designed to copy individual files only

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cp -n /etc/skel/.* ~                                      
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory '/etc/skel/.'                          
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory '/etc/skel/..'                         
sysadmin@localhost
```

The command you ran attempts to copy hidden files (those that start with a dot, such as `.bashrc`, `.profile`, etc.) from `/etc/skel/` to your home directory (`~`). However, it’s giving you the messages:

```bash
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory '/etc/skel/.'
cp: -r not specified; omitting directory '/etc/skel/..'
```

This happens because the `cp` command tries to copy the directories `.` (the current directory) and `..` (the parent directory) when you use `.*`, and it doesn’t have the `-r` (recursive) option specified to copy directories.

To avoid copying these directories and just copy the hidden files, you can adjust your command like this:

```bash
cp -n /etc/skel/.[!.]* ~
```

Here's what this does:

- `.[!.]*` matches hidden files that don’t begin with `..`, effectively skipping `.` and `..`.
- `-n` is used to prevent overwriting existing files in the destination.

This will copy only the hidden files from `/etc/skel` to your home directory without the `.` and `..` directories.

> ####  what is recursive ?

performing a process repeatedly in a self similar way

In computing, recursion generally involves a function or operation that calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem until reaching a base condition that stops the repetition.

```
cp -r source_directory destination_directory
```
> Be careful with this option. The entire directory structure will be copied which could result in copying a lot of files and directories!

The `-r` and `-R` serve the same purpose in the cp command but if used with other commands the `-r` command changes to reverse sort  when using the `ls` command
