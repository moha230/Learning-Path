# 8.4 Moving Files

In order to move a file we use the `mv` command 

```linux
mv source destination 
```

# 8.4.1 Renaming Files

The `mv`command is not used to move files but also rename a file 

* If the destination for the mv command is a directory, the file is moved to the directory specified


* The name of the file only changes if a destination file name is also specified.

```bash

mv source destination_directory/new_name_for_source_file 

mv example.text Videos/new_example.txt

```

* if a destination directory is not specified The file renamed using the destination file name and it remains in the source directory

For example, the following commands renames the newexample.txt file to myfile.txt:

```bash
sysadmin@localhost:~$ cd Videos                                        
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ ls                                        
hosts  newexample.txt                                                  
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ mv newexample.txt myfile.txt           
sysadmin@localhost:~/Videos$ ls
hosts  myfile.txt
```

>Think of the above `mv` example as move the `newexample.txt` file from the current directory to the current directory and give the new file the name `myfile.txt`

# 8.4.2 Additional Move Options

like the cp command the mv command provides the following options 
 --------
| options | Meaning |
| ---------|  --------|
|  -i    | interactive Ask if a file is to be overwritten.|
|  -n  | No Clobber: Do not overwrite a destination file's contents.|
| -v | Verbose: Show the resulting move.|

what is clobber ? 

overwriting or replacing existing data of files 

> There is no -r option as the mv command moves directories by default.
